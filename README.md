# Read me


This project creates a Java application that uses a MongoDB database which contains a list of movies, movie comments, reviews and users along with other details. This application allows users to query certain fields within the database, while following the spring architecture layout: Entities->Repository->Service->Controller We implement RestAPIs and endpoints to allow the following CRUD methods.

    GET /web/movies/add-city: Adds a new movie.
    GET /web/movie: Retrieves all movies.
    GET /web/movie/{id}: Retrieves a movie by its ID.
    GET /web/movie/delete/{id}: Deletes a movie by its ID.

    The above is similar for the comments and theaters and users controller


# CI/CD Pipeline

This project implements a robust Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to ensure smooth and automated delivery of updates. Here's an overview of the process:

1. **Version Control**: The main branch of our repository represents the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

2. **Automated Builds**: When changes are pushed to the main branch, a webhook is sent to our Jenkins server.

3. **Build Process**: Jenkins triggers a build using Maven, compiling and testing the application.

4. **Containerization**: The application is then containerized using Docker, creating a portable and consistent environment.

5. **Image Repository**: The Docker image is uploaded to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) for storage and versioning.

6. **Deployment**: Jenkins triggers an update on AWS App Runner, which pulls the new image from ECR and deploys it automatically.

This CI/CD pipeline ensures that every push to the main branch results in an automated build, test, and deployment process, maintaining the reliability and up-to-date status of our application.

# Live Demo
